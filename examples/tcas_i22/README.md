# TCAS-I 22 Senputing

This example describes the sensor design from paper: [Senputing: An Ultra-Low-Power Always-On Vision Perception Chip Featuring the Deep Fusion of Sensing and Computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9464962)

In this example, we simulate a BNN network. The first FC layer is operated in analog domain and the 
second layer is operated in digital domain.
