# JSSC 21 0.5V

This example describes the sensor design from paper: [A 0.5-V Real-Time Computational CMOS Image Sensor With Programmable Kernel for Feature Extraction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9250500)

In this example, we only simulate the analog part of this sensor design which contains a PWM pixel
array and a convolution PE array.
