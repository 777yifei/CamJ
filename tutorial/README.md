# Tutorial

The best way to learn how to use CamJ is to go through this tutorual.
We host the tutorial on a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F9E5SkY9DeoG6l7kP87fQ21-axBHhfW3?usp=sharing), which provides a step-by-step walk-through of how to use CamJ APIs to describe a simple computational CIS, both its software and hardware, and then perform functional (noise) and energy simulations.

To run the tutorial in standalone Python, do:
```
python3 tutorial_run.py
```
